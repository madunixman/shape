 OVERVIEW
==========

An account must be related to 3 entities:

- User
- Group
- Role

while the first two are conceived in the old canonical Unix way, the Role adds
the capability to enable different access policies to resources while being 
logged with the same user.


A Policy is an administration task that dinamically binds a Resource to a particular Role.
It also provides a permission string in the file 'perms'
to identify access permissions. It should be read this way:


<pre>

1 1 1
r w x--> Execute
| |
| +-->Write
+-->Read

</pre>




Resources can be internal (internal=1) or not (internal=0)
external resources must give a name for the field: 'externaltable'
which is an external table provided with a custom plugin
